# Diodepad
<hr>
Diodepad is a simple macropad with a 10 switches, visible diodes and a OLED screen.
Getting into this was pretty difficult, as I had no cad/pcb design experience.
Firmware was another challenge, which I do not yet know if it works
(will find out when hackpad comes, and in that moment adapt it).

## Features:

<ul>
    <li>128x32 OLED Display</li>
    <li>10 Keys</li>
    <li>Visible diodes ( they look cool )</li>
    <li>Minimalistic case</li>
</ul>
